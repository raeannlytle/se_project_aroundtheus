**Description and Techniques Used**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. I used Figma to find the correct elements sizing, spacing, and layout using grid displays and flexbox. I created media queries in my CSS to help the page flow when scaling down from a desktop screen to a mobile device. I tested the page from 320px up to 1500px to ensure the layout runs smoothly at different stopping points.
